## Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict car prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. It was developed as a final project during the 2nd year of the Computer Engineering program at UIC.

Project Features:
- Data Collection and Cleaning: Car data was collected, cleaned, and preprocessed for use in machine learning models.
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Insights were drawn from the data through detailed analysis and visualizations.
- Model Training and Evaluation: A regression model was trained and evaluated to predict car prices with high accuracy.
- Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn
- Visualization: matplotlib
This project showcases the application of machine learning to real-world problems, with a focus on regression modeling for price prediction.
